# PangeaRepo

This repo is for the developers of Pangea: An open world online game started by Josh and Alex.

Steps for using this repo:

(Suggestion) Download GitHub Desktop for ease of use.

This project is built in Unreal Engine 4 v. 4.24.3

Create a new level to add your scripts/assets to avoid clashes. Name these levels in a way they can be identified.

Create a new Branch with your name attached. i.e "John Smith's Branch"

Report to your team lead and/or producer BEFORE committing changes.

Describe all commits as best as possible.

This is going to be a fun project and a long learning experience for all of us! The best way this will be completed is to communicate with each other as best as we can. Good luck, we'll see you in Pangea!
